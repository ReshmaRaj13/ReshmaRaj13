# 👋 Hi, I'm Reshma R

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with 2+ years of experience and a strong background in **Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Generative AI**, and I hold a Master’s degree in **Electrical Engineering (Signal Processing & Communication)** from **IIT Tirupati**.

I have experience in building real-world AI systems across vision, language, and audio domains. I enjoy developing **end-to-end machine learning pipelines**—from data preparation and model training to real-time inference and cloud deployment.
